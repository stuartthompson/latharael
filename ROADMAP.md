# Roadmap

This file tracks a *(very rough)* project roadmap. It is likely that this file
does not completely align with the issues and milestones listed on GitHub.

The purpose of this file is to keep a record of high-level features and updates
that the author is planning, with a general sense of chronology for when they
might be added.

Some features may get rough version assignments within the roadmap, such as
features considered as required for a version 1.0.0, for example. However,
these are not guarantees of when an actual feature or update may be included.

This software is built on the side, for fun, and when the author can find time
to devote to the project. It is necessarily less rigid in its delivery
standards than a professionally developed project.

## Version 1.0.0

* First usable, working version of the software that doesn't completely suck.
* Sufficient features to create, upload, and simulate a player character.
* Logs, journals, and feedback sufficient to understand the outcomes a player
received from actions, and how their actions related to world, game, and player
state updates.
* Documentation, guides, and tutorials sufficient for players *(and the author)*
to understand how the world functions, how the game is played, and how future
updates may affect the game.
